# esp32s3-testboard
ESP32-S3 dev/poc board with some sensors

This is the first pcb with a microcontroller that I designed. It works with ESP32-S3-WROOM modules.

List of IC used on the board:
- ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 (Main MCU)
- BMP280 (i2C/SPI pressure and temperature sensor)
- CP2102N (USB-to-UART)
- SK6812 (RGBW led)
- LIS2DW12 (3-axis accelerometer)
